## 1.0 About

This project contains an experimental 6502 ROM monitor being developed
for the [Symon 6502 Simulator](http://github.com/sethm/symon) and
associated hardware.

## 2.0 Assembly

Assembled with [CA65](http://www.cc65.org/doc/ca65.html). Just
type `make`!

## 3.0 To Do

- Enhance the 'E' and 'D' commands to take '/' as the first
  argument, which will automatically increment the previously
  used Examine or Deposit address. e.g.:

```
     *D 0300 01   ; Deposit "01" to 0x0300
     *D / 02      ; Deposit "02" to 0x0301
     *D / 03      ; Deposit "03" to 0x0302
```
